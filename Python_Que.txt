What do you mean by *args and **kwargs?
---->*args and **kwargs are special keyword which allows function to take variable length argument.
*args passes variable number of non-keyworded arguments list and on which operation of the list can be performed.
**kwargs passes variable number of keyword arguments dictionary to function on which operation of a dictionary can be performed.
*args and **kwargs make the function flexible.


What is the iterator protocol?
Iterator in Python is simply an object that can be iterated upon. An object which will return data, one element at a time.
e use the next() function to manually iterate through all the items of an iterator. When we reach the end and there is no more data to be returned, it will raise the StopIteration Exception. Following is an example.

Technically speaking, a Python iterator object must implement two special methods, __iter__() and __next__(), collectively called the iterator protocol.

What is JSON? Describe in brief how you’d convert JSON data into Python data?
JavaScript Object Notation.You can parse a JSON string using json.loads() method. The method returns a dictionary.
import json

person = '{"name": "Bob", "languages": ["English", "Fench"]}'
person_dict = json.loads(person)

# Output: {'name': 'Bob', 'languages': ['English', 'Fench']}
print( person_dict)

# Output: ['English', 'French']
print(person_dict['languages'])



How would you display a file’s contents in reversed order?
Problem Solution
1. Take the file name from the user.
2. Read each line from the file using for loop and store it in a list.
3. Print the elements of list in reverse order.
4. Exit.
filename=input("Enter file name: ")
for line in reversed(list(open(filename))):
    print(line.rstrip())


Can you explain the filter(), map(), and reduce() functions?

What is pickling and unpickling?
The pickle module is used for implementing binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. 
Pickling: It is a process where a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream. 
Unpickling: It is the inverse of Pickling process where a byte stream is converted into an object hierarchy. 
dumps() – This function is called to serialize an object hierarchy.
loads() – This function is called to de-serialize a data stream.

What is the MRO in Python?
Method Resolution Order(MRO) it denotes the way a programming language resolves a method or attribute. Python supports classes inheriting from other classes. The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass. In python, method resolution order defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method. First, the method or attribute is searched within a class and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting. This order is also called Linearization of a class and set of rules are called MRO(Method Resolution Order). While inheriting from another class, the interpreter needs a way to resolve the methods that are being called via an instance. Thus we need the method resolution order. For Example
class A:
    def rk(self):
        print(" In class A")
class B(A):
    def rk(self):
        print(" In class B")  
r = B()
r.rk()
Output:
In class B


Explain join() and split() in Python.
split() method in Python split a string into a list of strings after breaking the given string by the specified separator.
  list_string = string.split(' ')
['Geeks', 'for', 'Geeks']
 string = '-'.join(list_string)
Geeks-for-Geeks
